## Configuration

The main configuration file is `config.php`. Before using the application, you need to configure it properly:

1. Edit `config.php` and change the `$basePath` variable to point to your audio directory:
   ```php
   $basePath = __DIR__ . '/audio'; // Change this to your audio directory
   ```

2. Make sure the path you specify exists and contains your audio files
3. Ensure the web server has read permissions for this directory

## API Endpoints

The application uses the following PHP endpoints:

- `api.php?action=list&path=PATH` - List directory contents
- `api.php?action=play&file=FILE` - Play an audio file
- `api.php?action=loadPlaylist&path=PATH` - Load a playlist file
